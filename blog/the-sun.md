# The sun has fallen down

I am not sure when it was; whether it was when I was born, when I took my first steps, spoke my first words, wrote my first poem; whether it was when I cried screams of childish terror at a 3 square inch portion of our mobile home carpet catching fire, or maybe it was when I lost my first friend; maybe it was when I stopped believing in divinity; maybe it was when I learned I was gay; maybe it was when I learned that my mother and I were (are) the same people, trapped in a strange land, when I learned she was unhappy in that small rural town with her children so far far away, her mother in the ground, and her father a continent apart; maybe it was when I, so young and naïve, learned that some children's favorite toy's were plastic bags not because they favored them but because there was nothing else to favor; maybe it was when the vice president called my people demons, or when the current president called us criminals; maybe it was when I broke things off with my first love, or maybe it was during the months after; maybe it was when I became homeless; maybe it was when I slept in a bathroom, cold tile, frosty floor; maybe it was yesterday; maybe I'm hoping it's tomorrow; maybe it is an innumerable and unpredictable number of years from now, and I am, in fact, a prophet. 

I really don't remember. I'm not quite sure when the sun fell down. 

Sometimes I see glimmers and rays, crepuscular, friendly, and tired (*solidified hope within my gaze*) of the fallen sun. Sometimes I think it will shoot back up into the sky. Sometimes I imagine that the sun is there, shining brighter than ever before, blinding me, us, with okayness. Sometimes I imagine that the great prophet, James Baldwin, will have his dream come true, and that when the sun does finally rise again, despite it being the last rise for many (*there will be a last rise for you and I as well*), we will nonetheless be unbound by our shackles: our totems and rituals, our taboos and blood sacrifices, our steeples, mosques, and synagogues, our races, armies, flags, nations, and families---our avoidance of death. Sometimes I imagine that bright blinding light from the sun---which has reclaimed its rightful spot in the sky is Baldwin's fire next time; that Baldwin's god has blinded us in fiery love.

But I look out and see the sun: not in the sky. Those radiant rays are not glimmers of light, but embers of the raging fire to come.

The fire next time will be from the fallen sun.
