I often wonder what my younger self would think of me now. I think many of us wonder the same thing; doesn't make my wondering any less special though. 

There would be things I would be proud of: going to class at Harvard and MIT, being an employed researcher, meeting people like Feng Zhang, Gil Strang, Noam Elkies, and Denis Auroux. And things I would not be so proud of: the smoking, the poverty, the homelessness.
