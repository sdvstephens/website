# Welcome to the Blog

This is the first post, testing **Markdown** and $\LaTeX$ rendering.

## Some Mathematics

Here's an inline equation: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$, Euler's identity.

And a display equation:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

## Group Theory Teaser

A **group** $(G, \cdot)$ satisfies three axioms:

1. **Associativity:** $(ab)c = a(bc)$ for all $a, b, c \in G$
2. **Identity:** There exists $e \in G$ such that $ea = ae = a$
3. **Inverses:** For each $a \in G$, there exists $a^{-1}$ such that $aa^{-1} = a^{-1}a = e$

The symmetric group $S_n$ has order $n!$, which grows fast:

| $n$ | $|S_n|$ |
|-----|---------|
| 3   | 6       |
| 4   | 24      |
| 5   | 120     |
