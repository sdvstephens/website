# Today is some days

Some days I feel like writing very little; others, a lot (*ambiguity of language*). Today is some days. 

I was learning about the absurdity that is Fisher, Land, and the like's Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU). It was rather odd, extraordinarily esoteric, fictionally enchanting, and undoubtedly brilliant. Those who took it as gospel, however, certainly have become lost in the plot (Land included); though I suppose that is precisely the point. 

I lost my phone today. I tend to do that. Lose things. In the 365 days I have lost my wallet at least 4 times (left in a bus station, a train station, on a bus, in a car), drivers license (left in a bathroom stall at a Costco and dropped it into the coin-sucking couch) 2 times, and my phone a minimum of 5 times. I am not sure if I will retrieve it this time. I certainly hope so. 

After therapy, in the heart of bustling Boston, I gazed out at the steel-glass and glass-brick structures, cultures, arts, and all, stretched out before me, spiraling to the sky. I was completely captivated by the sheer awe-some (as opposed to awesome) buildings that towered before me. I love what we do. I love what we build. 

I am not a great writer, I am realizing. But I want to be, and so I shall get better. Perhaps I will try to write something every day. No promises. 

Today has been a good day.
